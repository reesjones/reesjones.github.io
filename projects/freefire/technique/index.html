		<h1>Technique</h1>
		<p>Matt uses only the finest Borosilicate glass for his creations. All materials begin as solid rods, hollow tubes, or plates of solid glass. Everything is worked directly under a torch flame until the final form is reached. All items are annealed in a kiln for structural stability.</p>
		<br>
		<h2>What's the difference between borosiclicate and soft glass?</h2>
		<p>Glass is made from silica. Melting pure silica is possible, but requires an extremely high temperature. So, additional chemicals called "fluxes" are added to the silica to lower the melting temperature, and change the working characteristics.</p>
		<p>Various kinds of glass are distinguished by their <em>coefficient of expansion</em>, referred to as COE. Coefficient of expansion is defined as the amount of expansion (or contraction) per unit length of a material resulting from one degree change in temperature.</p>
		<p><em>"Hard glass"</em> is usually used in reference to borosilicate glass. You may know of it by one of it's common traded names: Pyrex. The primary fluxing agent is Boron Oxide. Borosilicate glass has a COE of around 33, and is a good glass for making sculptural objects and jewelry. It is the strongest glass, capable of being handled on a daily basis without weakening the structural integrity. Borosilicate, however, requires more heat in order to work it than soft glass.</p>
		<p><em>"Soft glass"</em> refers to the many brands of glass in the COE range of 90 to 104. Usually, the fluxing agent is Soda and Lime, hence the name, Soda-Lime glass. However, there are other 'soft' glasses, such as Leaded glass, which uses Lead Oxide as a fluxing agent. Most furnace workers work with 'soft glass' as it is preferred for making large sculptures and vessels.</p>
