The tera-PROMISE Repository is a long-term storage solution for research data, with a focus on software engineering datasets.

Datasets are stored in the categories listed on the left. These categories are not fixed (the more you contribute, the more our categories change). 

This repository is an update to the older PROMISE repository hosted on a Google Code site.
Our goal is to be a long term storage facility for SE data. [More info...](/repo/about)
