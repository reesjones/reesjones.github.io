#Notes from the Author

For more information on this data, see T. Menzies and M. Benson and K. Costello and M. Northey and J. Richardson, Learning Better IV&V Practices CSEE WVU and NASA IV&V, May 2007,[http://menzies.us/pdf/07ivv.pdf](http://menzies.us/pdf/07ivv.pdf) .

WBS.awk:
A list of tasks and their ids, and how they are selected based on
consequence (co) and error potential (ep). task 1. are management
tasks that occur across the lifecycle. tasks 2,3,4,5,6,7 are tasks at
"concept", "requirements", "design", "coding","testing", and "other"
phases (respectively)

CM10.csv:

The relative costs of performing IV&V tasks (sanitized, normalized, sums to 100).

Silap433.csv:

SILAP scores given to 433 NASA software components (parts of a project that received individual attention by IV&V)

TM1:

Frequency of IV&;V tasks (generated by running distributions of
Silap433 through SILAP).

KC10robot.csv:

The pattern of issue severity seen in robotic systems;

KC10human.csv:

The pattern of issue severity seen in human-rated systems.

Silap211.csv:

A mapping of SILAP scores on 211 components to their final issue
severities.
