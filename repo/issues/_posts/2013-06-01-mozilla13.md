#MOZILLA 13

This is a log of Mozilla defects.

  * A sanitized dump of the contents of Bugzilla, their issue tracker, going back 15 years or so.
  * A comprehensive list of our crash reports, going back about four years, and
  * The logs from their automated test harness, going back to 2002.


#URL

These files are very large, too big for Google code repos. Hence, these files are kept on another site;

  * To access the files on-line, see [mozilla](http://promisedata.org/data/mozillaApr13/).
