CM1 is a NASA spacecraft instrument (data collection and processing) written in "C".


At various times, researchers have negotiated access to the CM source code. Hence, it is somewhat more studied that some of the other NASA data sets. For, example, a UML model  
for CM1 is reverse engineered from the artifacts provided to West Virginia University.
