Hi, Sir, I downloaded the log4j-1.2 source codes. Taking the class “org.apache.log4j.Append” as example, it is an abstract class without any real codes inside. But the error report indicates there are two bugs inside. Is it possible because of different sub versions,like log4j-1.2.x ?

Expecting reply, thanks!

Ding
