This repository is an update to the older PROMISE repository of SE data.

Our goal is to be a long term storage facility for SE data.

Many researchers take the time to carefully host their data on their own web sites. But as people move through their career, those web sites can fade away and take away their data. Hopefully, using this repo, we can make conclusions in SE repeatable, and repeatable for a longer time.

This site has size restrctions (1TB, total) and we are chasing funds to change that (coming soon: peta-Promise?). That said, we are making progress. For example, this site can hold 500 times the data of the last version.

## History

This is version four of the Promise repository:

 * **Version 0:** Initially, in 2002, NASA ran the Metrics Data Program (MDP) for static code measures collected from NASA projects.
 * **Version 1:** In 2004, samples from MDP became the PROMISE v1.0 repository hosted at ottawa.ca. Founded by Tim Menzies and Jelber Sayyad, this repo was one of the first widely-used repositories of software engineering project data (mostly, static code attributes linked to defect and effort information). A key feature of the repository was that it was linked to an annual conference. Activity and contributions to the repository became linked to paper publication (both at the conference and at the seven journal special issues where the authors of best conference papers were invited to submit extended versions of their conference papers).
 * **Version 2:** That site grew and in 2006 was moved to a web-site supported by a home-brew macro system at promisedata.org.
 * **Version 3:** In 2008, after numerous security hacks, that site was moved to a more maintainable site at promisedata.googlecode.com. This third version was restricted in size to under 10GBs. Submissions to this repository and associated PROMISE conference grew to 2010. The PROMISE conference received (10,16,34,53) submissions in (2007,2008,2009,2010) which was an annual growth of (160,212,156). As of 2010, the repository was in widespread use (e.g. one study spent two hours on IEEE Explorer and found 73 papers that used the repository).
 * **Version 4:** In 2014, with support from N.C. State, that site was upgraded to terabyte size. At the same time, a support discussion forum was created at [http://openscience.us/ssj](http://openscience.us/ssj).
