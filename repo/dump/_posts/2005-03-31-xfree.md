#Notes from the Author

This is a PROMISE Software Engineering Repository data set made publicly
available in order to encourage repeatable, verifiable, refutable, and/or
improvable predictive models of software engineering.


1. Title: XFree86 Repository Transaction Data

2. Sources:
  (a) Original creators of database:

  (b) Donor of database: owner

  (c) Date received: 31 March 2005

3. Past Usage: none

4. Relevant Information:

This dataset was assembled by analyzing the publicly-available CVS archives of the XFree86 Project [http://xfree86.org)](http://xfree86.org)) using a modified version of CVSAnalY  ([https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY](https://github.com/MetricsGrimoire/CVSAnalY)) It is intended for a wide variety of uses, and thus no dependent variable is specified.  See Massey's PROMISE 2005 paper, "Longitudinal Analysis of Long-Timescale Open Source Repository Data", for further information.  Note that on 487 occasions, a negative lines-added count was recorded by CVSAnalY, apparently due to a bug.  These entries should probably be repaired or at least filtered out.

5. Number of Instances: 175658

6. Number of Attributes: 10 (incl. 2 inferred)

7. Attribute information:

   * Inferred filetype:
     * non-numeric---nominal
     * 9 values (documentation,images,i18n,ui,multimedia,code,build,devel-doc,unknown)
   * File Pathname: UNIX relative path name
     * non-numeric---structured
     * 1935 directories, 27009 files
   * Revision: dotted-decimal revision string
     * non-numeric---structured
     * 7182 unique revision numbers
   * Author ID: integer identifier
     * non-numeric---nominal
     * 21 unique authors
   * Lines added: integer
     * numeric---integer
     * MIN: 0  MAX: 699789  MEAN: 124.274  STDEV: 2450.66
     * MIN: 0  MAX: 70554  MEAN: 41.3577  STDEV: 407.737
     * (excl. images, multimedia)
     * Note: on 487 occasions, a negative lines-added count was recorded by CVSAnalY, apparently due to a bug. In the summary statistics reported in this comment, these additions are not counted.
   * Lines removed: integer
     * numeric---integer
     * MIN: 0  MAX: 123751  MEAN: 27.8503  STDEV: 624.008
     * MIN: 0  MAX: 55664  MEAN: 17.3073  STDEV: 294.047
     * (excl. images, multimedia)
   * File has since been removed ("in Attic"): boolean (0, 1)
     * non-numeric---nominal
     * 40.67% positive
   * Commit has CVS_SILENT flag: boolean (0, 1)
     * non-numeric---nominal
     * never set
   * Inferred that committer was not author: boolean (0, 1)
     * non-numeric---nominal
     * 1.04% positive
   * Commit date:  date
     * MIN: "1994-04-27 07:07:10"  MAX: "2005-02-19 02:22:07"
     * Note: CVS has trouble with timezones; we assume all dates are UTC.

8. Missing Attribute Values:

  * unknown inferred filetype (attr 1): 18719

9. Class Distribution:  N/A
