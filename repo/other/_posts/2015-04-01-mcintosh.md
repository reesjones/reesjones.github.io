#About the Data

##Overview of Data

In order to evaluate the impact that code review coverage and participation have on software quality, the authors extract code review data from the Gerrit review databases of the studied systems, and link the review data to the integrated patches recorded in the corresponding VCSs.

The data extraction approach is broken down into three steps: (1) extract review data from the Gerrit review database, (2) extract Gerrit change IDs from the VCS commits, and (3) calculate version control metrics.

##Paper abstract

Software code review, i.e., the practice of having third-party team members critique changes to a 
software system, is a well-established best practice in both open source and proprietary software 
domains. Prior work has shown that the formal code inspections of the past tend to improve the 
quality of software delivered by students and small teams. However, the formal code inspection 
process mandates strict review criteria (e.g., in-person meetings and reviewer checklists) to 
ensure a base level of review quality, while the modern, lightweight code reviewing process does 
not. Although recent work explores the modern code review process qualitatively, little research 
quantitatively explores the relationship between properties of the modern code review process and 
software quality. Hence, in this paper, we study the relationship between software quality and: 
(1) code review coverage, i.e., the proportion of changes that have been code reviewed, and (2) 
code review participation, i.e., the degree of reviewer involvement in the code review process. 
Through a case study of the Qt, VTK, and ITK projects, we find that both code review coverage 
and participation share a significant link with software quality. Low code review coverage and 
participation are estimated to produce components with up to two and five additional post-release 
defects respectively. Our results empirically confirm the intuition that poorly reviewed code 
has a negative impact on software quality in large systems using modern reviewing tools.
