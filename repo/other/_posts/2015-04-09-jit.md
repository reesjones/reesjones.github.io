##Paper Abstract

Prior research suggests that predicting defect-inducing changes,
i.e., Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction is a more practical
alternative to traditional defect prediction techniques, providing
immediate feedback while design decisions are still
fresh in the minds of developers. Unfortunately, similar to
traditional defect prediction models, JIT models require a
large amount of training data, which is not available when
projects are in initial development phases. To address this
flaw in traditional defect prediction, prior work has proposed
cross-project models, i.e., models learned from older
projects with su!cient history. However, cross-project models
have not yet been explored in the context of JIT prediction.
Therefore, in this study, we empirically evaluate the
performance of JIT cross-project models. Through a case
study on 11 open source projects, we find that in a JIT
cross-project context: (1) high performance within-project
models rarely perform well; (2) models trained on projects
that have similar correlations between predictor and dependent
variables often perform well; and (3) ensemble learning
techniques that leverage historical data from several other
projects (e.g., voting experts) often perform well. Our findings
empirically confirm that JIT cross-project models learned
using other projects are a viable solution for projects with
little historical data. However, JIT cross-project models perform
best when the data used to learn them is carefully selected.
