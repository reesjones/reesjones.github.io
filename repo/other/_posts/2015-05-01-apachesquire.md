##Paper Abstract


This paper outlines the steps in the creation and maintenance of a 
new dataset listing leaders of the various projects of the Apache 
Software Foundation (ASF). Included in this dataset are different 
levels of committers to the various ASF project code bases, as well 
as regular and emeritus members of the ASF, and directors and 
officers of the ASF. The dataset has been donated to the FLOSSmole 
project under an open source license, and is available for 
[download](https://code.google.com/p/flossmole/downloads/detail?name=apachePeople2013-Jan.zip), 
or for direct querying via a database client.
