#About the Data

For the empirical analysis, the authors created two datasets: dataset1 includes all change tasks 
that have at least one change set associated with them; dataset 2 is a subset of dataset 1 and 
includes all change tasks that have at least one change set and one task context associated. For 
the AspectJ project the authors only created dataset 1, since only two tasks had a task context 
associated. For each project the authors split each dataset into a training set to create the 
dictionary and a test set. For reasonable training and test sets and to be able to compare them 
across projects, they chose the test set size to be ten. Also, to be able to compare the results 
of the dictionaries using dierent in-formation sources (change sets and/or task contexts) as well 
as preserving the chronological order, they chose the last ten change tasks in dataset 2 as the 
test set for Mylyn.Tasks,Mylyn. Context and Remus and the last ten change tasks in dataset 1 for 
AspectJ. All change tasks that were resolved before the ones in the test set were used as the 
training set.

## Paper Abstract

At the beginning of a change task, software developers spend a substantial amount of their time 
searching and navigating to locate relevant parts in the source code. Current approaches to 
support developers in this initial code search predominantly use information retrieval techniques 
that leverage the similarity between task descriptions and the identifiers of code elements to 
recommend relevant elements. However, the vocabulary or language used in source code often 
differs from the one used for describing change tasks, especially since the people developing the 
code are not the same as the ones reporting bugs or defining new features to be implemented. In 
our work, we investigate the creation of a dictionary that maps the different vocabularies using 
information from change sets and interaction histories stored with previously completed tasks. 
In an empirical analysis on four open source projects, our approach substantially improved upon 
the results of traditional information retrieval techniques for recommending relevant code 
elements.
