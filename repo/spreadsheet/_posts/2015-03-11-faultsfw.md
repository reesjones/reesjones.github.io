#About the Data

##Abstract

Spreadsheets are by far the most used programs
that are written by end-users. They often build the basis for decisions
in companies and governmental organizations and therefore
they have a high impact on our daily life. Ensuring correctness
of spreadsheets is thus an important task. But what happens
after detecting a faulty behavior? This question has not been
sufficiently answered. Therefore, we focus on fault localization
techniques for spreadsheets. In this paper, we introduce a novel
dependency-based approach for model-based fault localization in
spreadsheets. This approach improves diagnostic accuracy while
keeping computation times short, thus making the automated
fault localization more appropriate for practical applications. The
presented approach allows for an acceptable fault localization
time of less than a second, and reduces the number of computed
root cause candidates by 15% on average, when compared with
another dependency-based approach.

##Data

This dataset contains 33 different spreadsheets (12 artificially created
spreadsheets and 21 real-life spreadsheets) and . These spreadsheets contain 
both arithmetical and logical operators as well as the functions SUM and 
IF. Faulty versions of the spreadsheets (containing single, double and 
triple faults) were created by randomly selecting formulas and applying
mutation operators on them.
