#About the Data

##Overview of Data

### 1) Eclipse data - 6 files, ~4GB
The first three of these files are CVS repository dumps form Eclipse-JDT, Eclipse-SWT, Eclipse-Platform, and Eclipse-Rest. In order to mine these, you will need to have a means of handling CVS repositories. The files are: 

 * eclipse-cvs-jdt.tgz
 * eclipse-cvs-swt.tgz
 * eclipse-cvs-rest.tgz

The fourth data file XML bug reports dumped from the Eclipse Bugzilla page. It is listed as:

 * eclipse-bugs.zip

### 2) Mozilla data - 5 files, ~4GB
The first of the Mozilla files is a CVS repository dump. In order to mine this, you will need to have a means of handling CVS repositories. The files are:
 
 * mozilla-cvs.tgz

The other four Mozialla files are XML bug reports dumped from the Firefox Bugzilla page. These were split into four separate files due to size limitations of the web server on which they were hosted. The files are:

 * mozilla-bugs-100001-200000.zip
