#About the Data

##Overview of Data

Studies who have been using the data (in any form) are required to add the following reference to their report/paper:

```

   booktitle={The 10th Working Conference on Mining Software Repositories},
   year={2013},
   pages={to appear}
}
```

### Data

The 2013 data is all from Stack Overflow. They have an XML-formatted "dump" from Stack Overflow with irrelevant entries removed, though I'm not sure what exactly this is a dump of. (file size >7GB) They also provide a progresqul-formatted dump of the same data.

XML: *201208_stack_overflow_official.tar.bz*

progresql: *201208_stack_overflow_postgres_dump.tar.bz*
