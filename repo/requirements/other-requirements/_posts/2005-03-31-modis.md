##Relevant Information

Requirements tracing is defined as "the ability to describe and follow
the life of a requirement, in both a forward and backward direction,
through the whole systems lifecycle[1](http://eprints.ucl.ac.uk/749/1/2.2_rtprob.pdf)."  It helps us in assuring that
all requirements have been implimented.

We have implemented and evaluated a variety of IR methods including
tf-idf vector retrieval, tf-idf retrieval with simple thesaurus, and
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI).

TF-IDF model:  "vector model (also known as tf-idf model) for information
retrieval is defined as follows. Let V = \{k1,...,kN\} be the vocabulary
of a given document collection. Then, a vecto r model of a document d is
a vector (w1,...,wN) of keywords weights, where wi is computed as wi =
tfi(d)*idf , where tfi(d) is the so-called term frequency: the frequency
of keyword ki in the document d, and idfi, called inverse document
frequency is computed as idfi = log(n/dfi), where n is the number of
documents in the document collection and dfi is the number of documents
in which keyword ki occurs. Given a document vector d=(w1,...,wN) and
 a similarly computed query vector
q=(q1,...,qN) the similarity between d and q is defined as the cosine
of the angle between the vectors.[+ Simple Thesaurus: "This method extends tf-idf model with a
simple thes aurus of terms and key phrases. A simple thesaurus T is a
set of triples <t1,t2,a>, where t1 and t2 are matching thesaurus terms
and a is the similarity coefficient between them. Thesaurus terms can
be either single keywords or key phrases(sequences
 of two or more keywords). The vector model is augmented to account for
 thesaurus matches as follows. First, all
thesaurus terms that are not keywords (i.e., thesaurus terms that
consist of more than one keyword) are added as separate keywords to
the document collection vocabulary. Given a thesaurus T=\{<ki,kj,aij>\},
and document/query vectors d=(w1,...,wN), q=(q1,...,qN), the similarity
between d and q is compute d[2](2]"

TF-IDF)."

Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) : "LSI is a dimension reduction technique
based on Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the term-by-document matrix
that can be constructed by putting tf-idf vectors of all documents in a
single matrix. SVD transforms the original matrix into a product of two
orthogonal matrices and a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues.  By considering
only the top k eigenvalues, we can obtain an appro ximation of the
original matrix by a smaller matrix. Rows of the matrix can be compared
to each other using the cosine similarity described above.[Feedback : To incorporate interactive work with analyst
into RETRO, we have implemented  relevance feedback for the IR methods
studied.  Relevance feedback works as follows: the analyst conveys to
RETRO both positive (true link found) and negative (false positive found)
information. The relevance feedback processor recomputes the vector qnew
for the query q by adding to it positive information and subtracting
negative information as specified in [2](3]"

Relevance).

Dataset details : This dataset is a modified dataset from [based
on open source NASA Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
(MODIS) documents. The dataset contains 19 high level and 49 low-level
requirements. The trace for the dataset was manually verified. The
"theoretical true trace" (answerset) built for this dataset consisted of
41 correct links. Each of the high and low-leve files contain the text
of one requirement element. Take, for example, SDP3.2-2.  The file with
the name SDP3.2-2 is a text file that contains:

Each MODIS standard data product shall be produced within the data volume
and processing load allocation shown in Table B-1 in plain text.

The files in the high and the low directory are in the same format.

The handtrace.txt file is the answerset. It maps high-level requirements
to their low level children.

The handtrace.txt file has this format:

%
SDP3.2-2 L1APR01-I-3
%
SDP3.3-1 L1APR01-I-1
%
SDP3.3-2 L1APR03-I-2 L1APR01-I-2
%
SDP3.3-4 L1APR03-I-2 L1APR01-I-2 L1APR01-I-1
..
..
..
..

where SDP3.2-2 is the identifier of a high level requirement, and
L1APR01-I-3 is the identifier of the only low level requirement that
traces to it. The items are separated by tabs.

So, for example, high-level requirement SDP3.3-4 has three children
requirements: L1APR03-I-2, L1APR01-I-2, L1APR01-I-1.

Metrics: 

a) RECALL is the percentage of the actual matches that are found. 

        recall = number of links found/ total number of links

b) PRECISION is the ratio of the true links found and the number of candidate 
   links generated.

        precision = number of links found/ total number of candidate links

Please refer to [2](http://selab.netlab.uky.edu/homepage/publications/RE2004-camera-edit%5Ev4.pdf) for the definition of other primary and secondary metrics.

### Feedback strategy:

"For each method, four different feedback strategies or behaviors,
called Top 1, Top 2, Top 3 and Top 4 were tested.  The Top i behavior
meant that at each iteration, we simulated correct analyst feedback for
the top i unmarked candidate links from the list for each high-level
requirement. For example, for each high level requirement, Top 1 behavior
examined the top candidate link suggested by the IR procedure that
had not yet been marked as true. If the link was found in the verified
trace, it was marked as true, otherwise as false. After repeating the
Top i relevance feedback procedure for each high level requirement,
the answers were submitted to the feedback processing module.  At this
point, the Standard Rochio procedure was used to update query (high-level
requirement) keyword weig hts, and to submit the new queries to the IR
method. The process continued for a maximum of eight iterations or until
the results had converged.[technique:

A filtering technique is a simple decision procedure that examines each
candida te link produced by the IR method and decides whether to show it
to the analyst. In our study, in addition to the test run involving no
filtering, we used filters with different threshold values. For example,
filter with threshold value 0.1 will throw out all the candidate links
that have relevance less than 0.1.
