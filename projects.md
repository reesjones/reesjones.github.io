Here's a few of the more notable webdev/software/other projects I've done in the past:


## A software engineering research data repository [[link]](http://openscience.us/repo)

I built a data repository site from scratch using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 
and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (the site generator that GitHub Pages uses). The goal
of the site is to provide free storage of/access to software engineering research datasets.



## Scrabble application with native Java [[link]](https://github.com/reesjones/scrabble)

A native Java implementation of the Scrabble board game, written as a final project for my
first computer science class! It has many core CS concepts baked in, including searching &
sorting algorithms, GUIs (with Java Swing framework), legal tile placement and scoring
algorithms, etc.



## Newton Fractal generator [[link]](https://github.com/reesjones/nfrac)

A procedural python script that generates Newton Fractals in the complex plane. It doesn't
have a GUI unfortunately (Newton fractals are pretty!) but it uses Newton's method to generate
a matrix of hex colors that *could* be used for a GUI.



## Some basic data structure implementations [[link]](https://github.com/reesjones/data-structures)

For my data structures class at [NCSSM]() I implemented an array-based list, linked list, hash
table, and a few sorting algorithms (bubble sort, merge sort).



## Upcoming: an Android app!

Stay tuned. (9/26/15)
