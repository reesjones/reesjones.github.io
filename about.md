## Hello, my name is Mitch Rees-Jones.

<hr>

# Who am I?

I’m a Computer Science major/mathematics minor and 
[University Honors Program](http://honors.dasa.ncsu.edu/) student living and 
learning in Raleigh, NC at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/).

During my junior and senior years of high school, I attended the 
[North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics](http://ncssm.edu/) (NCSSM), 
a public residential high school for juniors and seniors that provides a 
specialized STEM-focused curriculum for academically talented North Carolina 
students.

# What do I do?

While my experience lends itself more to full-stack development, I'm more 
interested in, and now pursuing, more infrastructure, backend, data science, 
data mining, machine learning opportunities. I did 
some data infra work when working on [Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) at my summer 
'16 Facebook internship, and am currently doing data mining research at NC State.

Here is my skillset, listed in order of *more expertise => less expertise*:

| Category          | My Skills
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| **Languages**     | Java, Javascript, Hack, C, Python
| **Frameworks**    | React.js, Flow (JS type checker), GraphQL, Spring (Java), Bootstrap
| **Platforms**     | Linux & OSX & Windows, AWS, Node.js, Android (some)
| **Tools & IDEs**  | Mercurial, Git/GitHub, Subversion, Nuclide, IntelliJ, Eclipse
| **Specialties**   | IDEs, REST architecture, full stack development, Agile

I also have experience with human factors including: 

 * Code reviews
 * Working on a team
 * Learning huge codebases
 * Source control at scale

# What do I do in my free time?

I run on the club cross country & track team at NCSU, play piano and cajon, 
travel, and hike really tall mountains, among other things. I also cook and 
occasionally make recipes and post them on this site.

# Why do I have a website?

**The short:** It is (1) A place to store my projects in a publicly available 
portfolio, and (2) A way to improve my communication and documentation skills 
and (3) To see how my interests and skills evolve over time.

**The long:** I started programming in 2008, when I discovered batch files through 
a family friend who works at IBM. I developed a small series of batch programs, 
and although they didn’t really do much past opening websites and storing usernames 
in a text file, they were a fun introduction to coding. When I started school 
at NCSSM, I learned HTML, CSS, Python, and Java through the CS classes I took 
in two years. Over time, my projects piled up, and organization was messy at 
best. Over the summer, I learned git and started migrating my 
[projects](/projects) to GitHub, in order to create a system with which I can 
better document and organize my projects and coding habits. I decided that the 
best way to manage these projects was with a personal website, and here we are.

Additionally, it serves as a public portfolio and ‘extended resume’ for potential employers.

I also enjoy tinkering with code, ideas, and social conventions.

# What am I working on now?

As of Fall 2016, I'm doing undergrad research in data mining and taking Software 
Engineering, Automata, and Probability (because I suck at probability, and must 
get better).
