## Hello, my name is Mitch Rees-Jones.

<hr>

# Who am I?

I’m a Computer Science major/mathematics minor and [University Honors Program](http://honors.dasa.ncsu.edu/) student living and learning in Raleigh, NC at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). I'm the tech lead of [Freshspire](http://www.getfreshspired.com/), a startup building a mobile platform which helps grocery stores sell their nearly-expired discounted food, and helps people like you find it.

During my junior and senior years of high school, I attended the [North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics](http://ncssm.edu/) (NCSSM), a public residential high school for juniors and seniors that provides a specialized STEM-focused curriculum for academically talented North Carolina students.

# Why do I have a website?

**The short:** It is (1) A place to store my projects in a publicly available portfolio, and (2) A way to improve my communication and documentation skills and (3) To see how my interests and skills evolve over time.

**The long:** I started programming in 2008, when I discovered batch files through a family friend
who works at IBM. I developed a small series of batch programs, and although they didn’t really do
much past opening websites and storing usernames in a text file, they were a fun introduction to 
coding. When I started school at NCSSM, I learned HTML, CSS, Python, and Java through the CS
classes I took in two years. Over time, my projects piled up, and organization was messy at best. Over the summer, I learned git and started migrating my 
[projects](/projects) to GitHub, in order to create a system with which I can better document and
organize my projects and coding habits. I decided that the best way to manage these projects was 
with a personal website, and here we are.

Additionally, it serves as a public portfolio and ‘extended resume’ for potential employers.

# What can I do?

My strongest language is Java, and I’ve built a number of large-ish [projects](/projects) in it. I’ve also used a number of other languages and tools, summarized below:

**Languages:**   Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, C, Python

**Server-side:**   Spring Framework, Angular.js, Node.js, Bootstrap, WordPress, Android SDK

**Platforms:**   Linux/Bash, Windows, Amazon Web Services, Digital Ocean

**Tools & IDEs:**   IntelliJ, Eclipse, Git/GitHub, Subversion, vim, Android Studio

**Topics:**   Agile development, software for early stage startups, REST APIs design & implementation, data structures & algorithms

# What else do I do?

In the other areas of my life, I enjoy running cross country and track, playing piano, travelling, and juggling, among other things.

I also enjoy tinkering with code, ideas, and social conventions.

# What am I working on now?

As of spring 2016, I'm developing the backend for [Freshspire](http://www.getfreshspired.com/) and taking Assembly and Operating Systems.
