## Hello, my name is Mitch Rees-Jones.

<hr>

# Who am I?

I’m a Computer Science major/mathematics minor and University Honors student living and learning in Raleigh, NC at North Carolina State University. During my junior and senior years of high school, I attended the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM), a public residential high school for juniors and seniors that provides a specialized STEM-focused curriculum for academically talented North Carolina students.

I’m still exploring what I would like to do in computer science, and I’m currently trying to figure that out as an intern at IBM Watson this summer. Academically, I enjoy my math and CS/engineering classes the most. And I like to read.

# Why do I have a website?

**The short:** It is 1. A place to store my projects in a publicly available portfolio, and 2. A way to improve my communication and documentation skills and 3. To see how my interests and skills evolve over time.

**The long:** I started programming in 2008, when I discovered batch files through a family friend who works at IBM. I developed a small series of batch programs, and although they didn’t really do much past opening websites and storing usernames in a text file, they were a fun introduction to coding. When I started school at NCSSM, I learned HTML, CSS, Python, and Java through the various CS classes I took in two years. Over time, the projects I created for school and on my own time piled up, and organization was messy at best. Over the summer, I learned git and started migrating my projects to GitHub, in order to create a system with which I can better document and organize my projects and coding habits. I decided that the best way to manage these projects was with a personal website, hence www.reesjones.co.

Additionally, it serves as a public portfolio and ‘extended resume’ for potential employers.

# What can I do?

My strongest language is Java, and I’ve built a number of large-ish projects in it. I’ve also used a number of other languages and tools, summarized below:

**Languages:**   Java, Python, HTML/CSS/LESS, limited batch & Arduino
**Server-side:**   WordPress, Jekyll, limited website hosting capabilities
**Platforms:**   Linux/Ubuntu 14.04, Win7 & XP, bash shell & terminal emulators
**Tools & IDEs:**   Eclipse, GitHub & git, vim, Sublime Text 2, Dr. Java
**Topics:**   Data structures, Java Swing framework, sorting, searching, algorithm analysis

# What else do I do?

In the other areas of my life, I enjoy running cross country and track, playing piano, and juggling, among other things.

I also enjoy tinkering with code, ideas, and social conventions.

# What am I working on now?

As of summer 2015, I’m ~~drinking from the proverbial firehose~~ interning at IBM Watson (and enjoying it immensely so far), reading A Brief History of Time,  and occasionally doing some web development/design at openscience.us.

# Check me out!

* I post projects on my GitHub account
* I sometimes use StackOverflow
* I can also be contacted via LinkedIn or Google+
