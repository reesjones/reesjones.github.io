## Hello, my name is Mitch Rees-Jones.

<hr>

# Who am I?

I’m a Computer Science major/mathematics minor and [University Honors Program](http://honors.dasa.ncsu.edu/) student living and learning in Raleigh, NC at [North Carolina State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/). During my junior and senior years of high school, I attended the [North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics](http://ncssm.edu/) (NCSSM), a public residential high school for juniors and seniors that provides a specialized STEM-focused curriculum for academically talented North Carolina students.

I have strong interests in social entrepreneurship and computer science research (both of which I am just starting to get into). I have lots of experience in software and web development, and I'm also currently learning Android development.

# Why do I have a website?

**The short:** It is 1. A place to store my projects in a publicly available portfolio, and 2. A way to improve my communication and documentation skills and 3. To see how my interests and skills evolve over time.

**The long:** I started programming in 2008, when I discovered batch files through a family friend 
who works at IBM. I developed a small series of batch programs, and although they didn’t really do 
much past opening websites and storing usernames in a text file, they were a fun introduction to 
coding. When I started school at NCSSM, I learned HTML, CSS, Python, and Java through the various CS 
classes I took in two years. Over time, the projects I created for school and on my own time piled 
up, and organization was messy at best. Over the summer, I learned git and started migrating my 
[projects](projects.html) to GitHub, in order to create a system with which I can better document and
organize my projects and coding habits. I decided that the best way to manage these projects was 
with a personal website, and here we are.

Additionally, it serves as a public portfolio and ‘extended resume’ for potential employers.

# What can I do?

My strongest language is Java, and I’ve built a number of large-ish [projects](projects.html) in it. I’ve also used a number of other languages and tools, summarized below:

**Languages:**   Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, C, Python
**Server-side:**   Angular.js, Node.js, Bootstrap, WordPress, Android SDK
**Platforms:**   Linux/Bash, Windows, IBM Bluemix & DevOps platforms
**Tools & IDEs:**   Eclipse, Git/GitHub, Subversion, vim, Android Studio
**Topics:**   Agile development, REST APIs, data structures, algorithms, logic

# What else do I do?

In the other areas of my life, I enjoy running cross country and track, playing piano, and juggling, among other things.

I also enjoy tinkering with code, ideas, and social conventions.

# What am I working on now?

As of fall 2015, I'm learning Android development, C, and data structures/algorithms. I'm also in a math class with lots and lots of proofs and abstract thinking.
