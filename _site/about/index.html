  <h2>Hello, my name is Mitch Rees-Jones.</h2>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<p>I’m a Computer Science major/mathematics minor and University Honors student living and learning in Raleigh, NC at North Carolina State University. During my junior and senior years of high school, I attended the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics (NCSSM), a public residential high school for juniors and seniors that provides a specialized STEM-focused curriculum for academically talented North Carolina students.</p>

<p>I’m still exploring what I would like to do in computer science, and I’m currently trying to figure that out as an intern at IBM Watson this summer. Academically, I enjoy my math and CS/engineering classes the most. And I like to read.</p>

<h1>Why do I have a website?</h1>

<p><strong>The short:</strong> It is 1. A place to store my projects in a publicly available portfolio, and 2. A way to improve my communication and documentation skills and 3. To see how my interests and skills evolve over time.</p>

<p><strong>The long:</strong> I started programming in 2008, when I discovered batch files through a family friend who works at IBM. I developed a small series of batch programs, and although they didn’t really do much past opening websites and storing usernames in a text file, they were a fun introduction to coding. When I started school at NCSSM, I learned HTML, CSS, Python, and Java through the various CS classes I took in two years. Over time, the projects I created for school and on my own time piled up, and organization was messy at best. Over the summer, I learned git and started migrating my projects to GitHub, in order to create a system with which I can better document and organize my projects and coding habits. I decided that the best way to manage these projects was with a personal website, hence www.reesjones.co.</p>

<p>Additionally, it serves as a public portfolio and ‘extended resume’ for potential employers.</p>

<h1>What can I do?</h1>

<p>My strongest language is Java, and I’ve built a number of large-ish projects in it. I’ve also used a number of other languages and tools, summarized below:</p>

<p><strong>Languages:</strong>   Java, Python, HTML/CSS/LESS, limited batch &amp; Arduino
<strong>Server-side:</strong>   WordPress, Jekyll, limited website hosting capabilities
<strong>Platforms:</strong>   Linux/Ubuntu 14.04, Win7 &amp; XP, bash shell &amp; terminal emulators
<strong>Tools &amp; IDEs:</strong>   Eclipse, GitHub &amp; git, vim, Sublime Text 2, Dr. Java
<strong>Topics:</strong>   Data structures, Java Swing framework, sorting, searching, algorithm analysis</p>

<p>For more information, view my resume!</p>

<h1>What else do I do?</h1>

<p>In the other areas of my life, I enjoy running cross country and track, playing piano, and juggling, among other things.</p>

<p>I also enjoy tinkering with code, ideas, and social conventions.</p>

<h1>What am I working on now?</h1>

<p>As of summer 2015, I’m ~~drinking from the proverbial firehose~~ interning at IBM Watson (and enjoying it immensely so far), reading A Brief History of Time,  and occasionally doing some web development/design at openscience.us.</p>

<h1>Check me out!</h1>

<ul>
<li>I post projects on my GitHub account</li>
<li>I sometimes use StackOverflow</li>
<li>I can also be contacted via LinkedIn or Google+</li>
</ul>
