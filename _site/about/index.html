  <h2>Hello, my name is Mitch Rees-Jones.</h2>

<p><hr></p>

<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<p>I’m a Computer Science major/mathematics minor and <a href="http://honors.dasa.ncsu.edu/">University Honors Program</a> student living and learning in Raleigh, NC at <a href="https://www.ncsu.edu/">North Carolina State University</a>. During my junior and senior years of high school, I attended the <a href="http://ncssm.edu/">North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics</a> (NCSSM), a public residential high school for juniors and seniors that provides a specialized STEM-focused curriculum for academically talented North Carolina students.</p>

<p>I have strong interests in social entrepreneurship and computer science research (both of which I am just starting to get into). I have lots of experience in software and web development, and I&#39;m also currently learning Android development.</p>

<h1>Why do I have a website?</h1>

<p><strong>The short:</strong> It is 1. A place to store my projects in a publicly available portfolio, and 2. A way to improve my communication and documentation skills and 3. To see how my interests and skills evolve over time.</p>

<p><strong>The long:</strong> I started programming in 2008, when I discovered batch files through a family friend 
who works at IBM. I developed a small series of batch programs, and although they didn’t really do 
much past opening websites and storing usernames in a text file, they were a fun introduction to 
coding. When I started school at NCSSM, I learned HTML, CSS, Python, and Java through the various CS 
classes I took in two years. Over time, the projects I created for school and on my own time piled 
up, and organization was messy at best. Over the summer, I learned git and started migrating my 
<a href="/projects">projects</a> to GitHub, in order to create a system with which I can better document and
organize my projects and coding habits. I decided that the best way to manage these projects was 
with a personal website, and here we are.</p>

<p>Additionally, it serves as a public portfolio and ‘extended resume’ for potential employers.</p>

<h1>What can I do?</h1>

<p>My strongest language is Java, and I’ve built a number of large-ish <a href="/projects">projects</a> in it. I’ve also used a number of other languages and tools, summarized below:</p>

<p><strong>Languages:</strong>   Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, C, Python</p>

<p><strong>Server-side:</strong>   Angular.js, Node.js, Bootstrap, WordPress, Android SDK</p>

<p><strong>Platforms:</strong>   Linux/Bash, Windows, IBM Bluemix &amp; DevOps platforms</p>

<p><strong>Tools &amp; IDEs:</strong>   Eclipse, Git/GitHub, Subversion, vim, Android Studio</p>

<p><strong>Topics:</strong>   Agile development, REST APIs, data structures, algorithms, logic</p>

<p>For more information, view my <a href="/resume">resume</a>!</p>

<h1>What else do I do?</h1>

<p>In the other areas of my life, I enjoy running cross country and track, playing piano, and juggling, among other things.</p>

<p>I also enjoy tinkering with code, ideas, and social conventions.</p>

<h1>What am I working on now?</h1>

<p>As of fall 2015, I&#39;m learning Android development, C, and data structures/algorithms. I&#39;m also in a math class with lots and lots of proofs and abstract thinking.</p>

<h1>Check me out!</h1>

<ul>
<li>Lots of my projects can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/reesjones">GitHub</a>.</li>
<li>I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/reesjones">LinkedIn</a> too.</li>
<li>I sometimes use <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/2029568">StackOverflow</a>.</li>
