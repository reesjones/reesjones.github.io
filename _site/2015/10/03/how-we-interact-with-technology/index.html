  <h1 class="post-title">How we interact with technology</h1>
  <span class="post-date">03 Oct 2015</span>
  <ul>
<li>Technology is an attention-stealer</li>
<li>Despite my career path, I don&#39;t like how people are interacting with technology. Specifically,
I don&#39;t like how people are interacting with their mobile devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Later today I&#39;m going to get on a bus to go to the centennial campus of NC State for
a computer science class. If history is any indication, between half and two thirds of the riders 
will be actively engaged phone or, at the very least, have their phone out of their pocket, holding it
in their hands. It&#39;s an addiction. We&#39;re unconsciously waiting for another buzz or notification all
the time and it&#39;s killing our attention span.</p>

<p>I read an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/stop-googling-lets-talk.html">article</a> 
in the New York Times about how we interact with technology.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wish we could interact with our most personal technology devices in a different way. Right now,
our mobile devices are constantly-available attention seekers. They deprive us of attention and it&#39;s
hurting us psychologically.</li>
<li>I wish our devices were periodic. Let&#39;s view human attention like a computing resource, for
example, such as processing resources. When software engineers design programs, they must be conscious
of their usage of resources. Can&#39;t be too greedy, but the job (whatever it may be) must be done.</li>
</ul>

<p>What if our devices were the so called &#39;developers&#39; competing for &#39;resources&#39;, e.g. attention span?</p>

<p>Technology devices should respect this scarcity of the &#39;attention&#39; resource. If only there was a way
for technology to be non-disruptive. What if your phone was set to only check for notifications or
emails or texts every hour? Every day? What if it was a conscious request that the user had to make?
Instead of a phone beeping whenever something comes in, what if I had to consciously tell my device
to check for updates?</p>

<p>I think something like that would do a lot of good to the psychological health of today&#39;s tech-infused
generation. I remember when I went on a backpacking trip on the app trail and my group of friends set
a rule of no technology - except for a daily check of the phone for emergency texts from parents.</p>

<p>Is this a problem that can be solved technologically? Or is it a cultural one? It&#39;d be ironic to use
technology to get people away from technology and toward human interaction. Maybe a mass cultural
paradigm shift is required.</p>

<p>Is this concept of a non-interruptive phone/device profitable? What if I started a company that made
devices that you interacted with in a way that wasn&#39;t detrimental to your attention span? I&#39;d imagine
that it&#39;d only appeal to people who are consciously trying to get away from constant immersion and 
global availability online. Maybe something like this should be targeted specifically to those types
of people, and if it does a good enough job, others might see the benefit and &#39;switch over&#39;.</p>
