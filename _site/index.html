        How we interact with technology
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Oct 2015</span>

    <ul>
<li>Technology is an attention-stealer</li>
<li>Despite my career path, I don&#39;t like how people are interacting with technology. Specifically,
I don&#39;t like how people are interacting with their mobile devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>Later today I&#39;m going to get on a bus to go to the centennial campus of NC State for
a computer science class. If history is any indication, between half and two thirds of the riders 
will be actively engaged phone or, at the very least, have their phone out of their pocket, holding it
in their hands. It&#39;s an addiction. We&#39;re unconsciously waiting for another buzz or notification all
the time and it&#39;s killing our attention span.</p>

<p>I read an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/27/opinion/sunday/stop-googling-lets-talk.html">article</a> 
in the New York Times about how we interact with technology.</p>

<ul>
<li>I wish we could interact with our most personal technology devices in a different way. Right now,
our mobile devices are constantly-available attention seekers. They deprive us of attention and it&#39;s
hurting us psychologically.</li>
<li>I wish our devices were periodic. Let&#39;s view human attention like a computing resource, for
example, such as processing resources. When software engineers design programs, they must be conscious
of their usage of resources. Can&#39;t be too greedy, but the job (whatever it may be) must be done.</li>
</ul>

<p>What if our devices were the so called &#39;developers&#39; competing for &#39;resources&#39;, e.g. attention span?</p>

<p>Technology devices should respect this scarcity of the &#39;attention&#39; resource. If only there was a way
for technology to be non-disruptive. What if your phone was set to only check for notifications or
emails or texts every hour? Every day? What if it was a conscious request that the user had to make?
Instead of a phone beeping whenever something comes in, what if I had to consciously tell my device
to check for updates?</p>

<p>I think something like that would do a lot of good to the psychological health of today&#39;s tech-infused
generation. I remember when I went on a backpacking trip on the app trail and my group of friends set
a rule of no technology - except for a daily check of the phone for emergency texts from parents.</p>

<p>Is this a problem that can be solved technologically? Or is it a cultural one? It&#39;d be ironic to use
technology to get people away from technology and toward human interaction. Maybe a mass cultural
paradigm shift is required.</p>

<p>Is this concept of a non-interruptive phone/device profitable? What if I started a company that made
devices that you interacted with in a way that wasn&#39;t detrimental to your attention span? I&#39;d imagine
that it&#39;d only appeal to people who are consciously trying to get away from constant immersion and 
global availability online. Maybe something like this should be targeted specifically to those types
of people, and if it does a good enough job, others might see the benefit and &#39;switch over&#39;.</p>

        A tidbit of Java magic - integer caching
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Oct 2015</span>

    <p>I came across a code snippet on StackOverflow:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Integer a = 42;
Integer b = 42;
System.out.println(a == b);
Integer c = 555;
Integer d = 555;
System.out.println(c == d);
</code></pre></div>
<p>The first print statement prints <code>true</code> and the second one prints <code>false</code>.</p>

<p>Wait, what?</p>

<p>The second comparison makes sense. <code>==</code> in Java compares references to see if they
are the same object <em>in memory</em> (and primitives are compared by their literal value).
So <code>c == d</code> should return false, since they&#39;re not the same object in memory.
The <code>Object.equals()</code> method is a <em>functional</em> comparison, but it doesn&#39;t check
actual reference equality, e.g. it doesn&#39;t check the addresses of the reference variables.
So why does the first comparison equate to true?</p>

<p>The answer can be found in the Java Langauge Specification, <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-5.html#jls-5.1.7">chapter 5</a>.
Two primitives being autoboxed into references via a boxing conversion may qualify to
be cached for optimization purposes. Caching the more commonly used primitive values
leads to faster access time, so these certain commonly used primitives are cached:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>true</code>, <code>false</code></li>
<li><code>byte</code> or <code>char</code> in the range <code>\u0000</code> to <code>\u007f</code></li>
<li><code>int</code> or <code>short</code> in the inclusive range of -128 to 127</li>
</ul>

<p>So in the snippet above, <code>a == b</code> is true because <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> are between -128 and 127, so
when a new <code>Integer a = 42;</code> is created, it simply points to a previously cached Integer object.</p>

<p>Note that this only works when primitive <code>int</code>s are autoboxed to <code>Integer</code>s. If two <code>Integer</code>
objects are created (not autoboxed from the primitive type)...</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Integer e = new Integer(4);
Integer f = new Integer(4);
System.out.println(e == f);
</code></pre></div>
<p>...then the comparison will be false, since both <code>Integer</code> references were explicitly initialized
as separate objects.</p>

<p>Interesting stuff!</p>

        Arroz con pollo recipe

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">09 Aug 2015</span>

    <p>This is a divergence from the usually technically-oriented post. I&#39;ve never put a recipe up on my website, 
but I made up a pretty good arroz con pollo recipe that I&#39;ve made on a few occasions. It&#39;s kinda long to make, 
but really good hit the spot hearty cuban-ish food.</p>

<p><strong>Serves 6</strong></p>

<h2>Ingredients - need prep</h2>

<ul>
<li>Chicken - 3 breasts, cut to ~1.5 inch pieces</li>
<li>Half a red onion (cut to 3/4 inch squares)</li>
<li>Red &amp; green bell pepper - half a pepper each kind (cut into strips)</li>
<li>3 sweet potatoes (large dice - 3/4 inch)</li>
<li>Garlic (finely chopped, or if you&#39;re lazy like me, a bit of garlic powder)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ingredients - no prep</h2>

<ul>
<li>Black rice and wild rice (1 cup each)</li>
<li>Olive oil (drizzle on sweet potatoes)</li>
<li>Black beans, half drained (2 cans - ~30 oz)</li>
<li>Diced tomatoes (1 can)</li>
<li>2 limes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Ingredients - spices</h2>

<ul>
<li>Italian seasoning/oregano (pick one)</li>
<li>Rosemary</li>
<li>Cumin</li>
<li>Some salt/pepper</li>
<li>Chile powder</li>
<li>Cilantro and extra lemon/lime(s) for garnish</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prep</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>[3 sweet potatoes] [olive oil] [Rosemary, cumin, cinnamon, salt/pepper]</strong> Preheat oven to 400. Peel and dice 3 sweet potatoes to approximately 3/4 inch cubes. Spread onto sheet pan and drizzle a bit of 
olive oil for moisture. Spice with rosemary leaves, cumin, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Use a spatula to lightly toss chunks until seasoning and 
oil is evenly distributed. Bake at 400 for 50 minutes.</li>
<li><strong>[Half a red bell pepper] [Half a green bell pepper] [Half a red onion]</strong> Chop half a red and half a green bell pepper (or any combination of pepper colors) into 1/2 inch by 3/4 inch strips and put in a bowl for later cooking. Chop half a 
red onion into 3/4 inch squares and mix with bell peppers.</li>
<li><strong>[Cumin, chile powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder or finely chopped garlic]</strong> Prepare spice mix by combining some ratio of cumin, chile powder, salt, pepper, and garlic powder into a small bowl. Not sure how much of each, just kinda splash it in there until there&#39;s enough. Or put it directly in the chicken/veggies sautee as needed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Cook</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>[1 cup black rice, 1 cup wild rice]</strong> Bring 1 cup of black rice and 1 cup of wild rice to a boil in uh...however much water the rice bag calls for, and for however 
long it says. Squeeze juice from 2 limes into rice and stir.</li>
<li><strong>[3 chicken breasts] [1 can diced tomatoes] [2 cans black beans, only 1 drained]</strong> Prep chicken by cutting off fat and cutting into large chunks (~1.5 inch). Sautee 5-7 minutes or until almost golden brown, and 
add vegetables from step 2. Add half of spice combination and sautee ~5mins, until vegetables are cooked. Add 1 can of diced 
tomatoes, 1 can drained black beans, and 1 can UNdrained black beans; bring to a simmer for 5 mins. and stir ingredients until mixed.</li>
<li>When sweet potatoes are done, remove from oven and add to chicken/beans simmer. And add the rest of the spice mix.</li>
<li><strong>[Cilantro]</strong> Serve the rice and the chicken mix as a topping. Use cilantro as a garnish.</li>
</ol>

<p>Goes well with cilantro lime corn (recipe soon to be posted?) and refried plantains (also soon to be posted?)</p>
