<p>Table I describes the defect content in three successive
releases of Eclipse, 2.0, 2.1, 3.0, at two levels of granularity:
files and packages. The data set has been aggregated from the
release archives and a bug repository. The release archives,
CVS and more recently GIT, provide entries related to the
commit history of a system. In Bugzilla, one can map each 
bug report to a release. For classification purposes, we divide packages/files into two classes - those with and without defects.
The complexity metrics for each package/file can be computed</p>

<p>from the archived builds of Eclipse. We utilized the same
complexity metrics used in [15].</p>

<p>Accurate detection of defects prior to product
release helps software engineers focus verification activities on
defect prone modules, thus improving the effectiveness of software
development. A common scenario is to use the defects from
prior releases to build the prediction model for the upcoming
release, typically through a supervised learning method. As
software development is a dynamic process, fault characteristics
in subsequent releases may vary. Therefore, supplementing the
defect information from prior releases with limited information
about the defects from the current release detected early, seems to
offer intuitive and practical benefits. We propose active learning
as a way to automate the development of models which improve
the performance of defect prediction between successive releases.
Our results show that the integration of active learning with
uncertainty sampling consistently outperforms the corresponding
supervised learning approach. We further improve the prediction
performance with feature compression techniques, where feature
selection or dimensionality reduction is applied to defect data
prior to active learning. We observe that dimensionality reduction
techniques, particularly multidimensional scaling with random
forest similarity, work better than feature selection due to
their ability to identify and combine essential information in
data set features. We present the improvements offered by this
methodology through the prediction of defective modules in the
three successive versions of Eclipse.</p>
