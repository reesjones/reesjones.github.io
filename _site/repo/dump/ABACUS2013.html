<h1 id="about-the-data">About the data</h1>

<p>This archive contains all the logs, datasets and results of the 255 combinations 
of the 8 injected faults, as well as the 8 executions of untouched and 
uninstrumented versions of Wordpress.</p>

<p>Each folder of this archive relates to a different scenario and has all the log 
files (including the standard output and standard error messages) and ABACUS 
tools’ output files generated during the experiment processing.</p>

<p>Each folder present the following structure:</p>

<p>ABACUS.stdout     - File with the standard output messages</p>

<p>ABACUS.stderr     - File with the standard error messages (includes the time and memory used in each execution)</p>

<p>ABACUS.log        - File with the PHPunit TAP log result</p>

<p>ABACUS.matrix     - File with the SFL’s hit-spectra matrix and the error vector</p>

<p>ABACUS.components - File with the map between the SFL’s hit spectra matrix and the correspondent code component</p>

<p>ABACUS.staccato   - File with the result of the STACCATO tool</p>

<p>ABACUS.barinel    - File with the result of the BARINEL tool</p>

<p>Note that the “vanilla” folders only have ABACUS.stdout, ABACUS.stderr and 
ABACUS.log files, because are related to the untouched and uninstrumented 
versions of Wordpress, and the ABACUS toolset was not used.</p>
