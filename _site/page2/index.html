        Career Fairs Not Just For Upperclassmen
      </a>

    <span class="post-date">14 Oct 2014</span>

    <p>On Tuesday, September 30th, I attended North Carolina State University’s Engineering Career Fair, one of the largest engineering recruitment fairs in the nation, with over 300 companies attending. I did the “meet ‘n greet” with many excellent hiring managers/industry professionals, and came back from over four hours of networking and self-advertising to find that many of my freshman friends hadn’t gone at all, and weren’t planning on going the next day, either (it was a two-day event).</p>

<p>If you’re a freshman with limited experience, it is likely that you will have a difficult time getting some kind of internship or summer opportunity. If this is the case, fear not. You’re in the same boat as most of your classmates. But instead of ditching career-building opportunities, embrace them early. Start today, when your ability to land a job or an internship isn’t mission-critical. Here are some of the things I’ve learned so far from my experiences at the NCSU Career Fair.</p>

<h2>Connections</h2>

<p>Network, network, network. Start as soon as you can.</p>

<p>When you apply to a company for any kind of position, a lot of your chances depend on your connections within the company. If you submit an application and tell a hiring manager that remembers you that you submitted it, they may expedite your application, and maybe even put in a good word or two.This can make or break an application. If you don’t go up to those company reps and talk to them and make an impression, it’s a huge lost opportunity. After all, it’s their job to talk to potential recruits like you.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t have good chances at any of the companies you’re interested in, introducing yourself to the company representatives and hiring managers sets you up for next year, especially if you can make enough of an impression that they remember you a year later. Long-term interest in a company looks really good.</p>

<h2>Skills development</h2>

<p>If you talk to a manager and get to the point where you know you’re not being considered as a potential hire, take the opportunity to learn what you can do to be attractive to the company in the future. Ask what skills they are looking for, what experiences or classes they like to see on your resume, or even what weaknesses they see in you as an applicant. This is very valuable knowledge that you can only really get from talking to them in person, and if you take the advice and run with it, your viability as a candidate for a position is greatly improved.</p>

<p>Not only that, but comparing and contrasting what various companies are looking for in their applicants can be useful. Focusing on developing the skills that 80% of the companies you talk to want is more effective than the skills that only 15% of the companies are looking for.</p>

<h2>Practice</h2>

<p>Simply practicing networking and selling yourself is a good habit to get into. Take advantage of your academic and professional youth and practice before you need a real job and it actually matters.</p>

<p>If you’re only a freshman, you’ve still got a whopping four years until you really need a job, but work experience over the summer or in a co-op will come sooner rather than later. Practicing your professionalism early can pay great dividends in the future when you’re more seriously seeking a job or other work experience.</p>

    <p>Hey there, thanks for visiting my blog! While you’re here, check out some of the stuff I’ve written and leave a comment, if you so desire.</p>

<p>I’ve never maintained a blog before, but my intention with this one is to keep a loose documentation of what I’m working on or thinking about on a day-to-day basis. I’ll be writing about software development, computer science, and technology in general from the perspective of an undergraduate computer science student. I’m new to blogging and publishing work online, so leave your thoughts in the comments. I’d love to hear them!</p>

<p>Check out some of my projects too!</p>
