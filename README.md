This is my website, [reesjones.github.io](http://reesjones.github.io)
=====================================================================

This is my personal website/blog/portfolio. I sometimes write blog posts and I
have some stuff about projects, reading, etc. that I've done.

It's hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), 
runs on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), 
and uses the [BlackDoc theme](https://github.com/karloespiritu/BlackDoc).
