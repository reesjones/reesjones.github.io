Here’s a little list of stuff I’ve read, am currently reading, and plan to read. The list includes 
books, online tutorials/websites, and blogs, and most were/are being/will be read independently, 
but there are a few I read for a class.

# The full list

### The Java Tutorials

Seriously, this is an awesome series of tutorials on almost everything about the core Java language. It’s written by the people who make Java, so it’s really accurate too. It’s also downloadable as a single manuscript!

### Pro Git – Scott Chacon & Ben Straub

The most complete introduction that I’ve found for git, the distributed version control system. git is what I primarily use for my projects, and I learned it all just with this free online book! Actually, I’m not done reading yet, but I will be soon.

### The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python

A cool series of tutorials similar to the Java Tutorials, but with included focus on specific applications of the Python language, such as web applications, GUI applications, networking, databases, etc.

### Coding Horror – blog by Jeff Atwood

A cool blog on software and web development. Recently, the author Jeff Atwood has turned more toward UX and the human dynamics of software which I’m not as interested in, but lots of the older stuff he’s written is really interesting.

### Code – Charles Petzold

A cool layman’s introduction to computer engineering and low-level machine language and assembly. Talks about “codes” in the literal sense, with some focus on binary and hex as well.

### Code Complete – Steve McConnell

Haven’t read this one yet, but I’m really looking forward to it. It’s a book about practical software engineering – and how to write clean, maintainable code. I heard about this one from the excellent blog, Coding Horror, written by the creator of StackOverflow and Discourse.

### Computer Networks – Andrew Tanenbaum

A dated (but therefore cheap!) textbook on…well, computer networking. Despite the publishing date of 2003, the fundamental concepts and models remain largely the same.

### PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, & CSS – Robin Nixon

I plan to read this for an upcoming secret project involving lots of web development.

### The Linux Command Line: A Complete Introduction – William Shotts

A great resource for the many tools available in the Linux terminal (bash shell). I’m currently reading this.

# Other random literature

Love & Math – Edward Frenkel

Cracking the Coding Interview – McDowell

A Brief History of Time – Stephen Hawking
