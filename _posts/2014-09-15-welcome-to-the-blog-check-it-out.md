title: Welcome to the Blog – Check it Out!
---

Hey there, thanks for visiting my blog! While you’re here, check out some of the stuff I’ve written and leave a comment, if you so desire.

I’ve never maintained a blog before, but my intention with this one is to keep a loose documentation of what I’m working on or thinking about on a day-to-day basis. I’ll be writing about software development, computer science, and technology in general from the perspective of an undergraduate computer science student. I’m new to blogging and publishing work online, so leave your thoughts in the comments. I’d love to hear them!

Check out some of my projects too!
