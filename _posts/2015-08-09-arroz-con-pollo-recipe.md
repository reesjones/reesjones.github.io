title: Arroz con pollo recipe
---

This is a divergence from the usually technically-oriented post. I've never put a recipe up on my website, 
but I made up a pretty good arroz con pollo recipe that I've made on a few occasions. It's kinda long to make, 
but really good hit the spot hearty cuban-ish food.

**Serves 6**

## Ingredients - need prep

 * Chicken - 3 breasts, cut to ~1.5 inch pieces
 * Half a red onion (cut to 3/4 inch squares)
 * Red & green bell pepper - half a pepper each kind (cut into strips)
 * 3 sweet potatoes (large dice - 3/4 inch)
 * Garlic (finely chopped, or if you're lazy like me, a bit of garlic powder)
 
## Ingredients - no prep
 
 * Black rice and wild rice (1 cup each)
 * Olive oil (drizzle on sweet potatoes)
 * Black beans, half drained (2 cans - ~30 oz)
 * Diced tomatoes (1 can)
 * 2 limes

## Ingredients - spices
 * Italian seasoning/oregano (pick one)
 * Rosemary
 * Cumin
 * Some salt/pepper
 * Chile powder
 * Cilantro and extra lemon/lime(s) for garnish
 
## Prep


 1. **[3 sweet potatoes] [olive oil] [Rosemary, cumin, cinnamon, salt/pepper]** Preheat oven to 400. Peel and dice 3 sweet potatoes to approximately 3/4 inch cubes. Spread onto sheet pan and drizzle a bit of 
olive oil for moisture. Spice with rosemary leaves, cumin, cinnamon, salt, and pepper. Use a spatula to lightly toss chunks until seasoning and 
oil is evenly distributed. Bake at 400 for 50 minutes.
 2. **[Half a red bell pepper] [Half a green bell pepper] [Half a red onion]** Chop half a red and half a green bell pepper (or any combination of pepper colors) into 1/2 inch by 3/4 inch strips and put in a bowl for later cooking. Chop half a 
red onion into 3/4 inch squares and mix with bell peppers.
 3. **[Cumin, chile powder, salt, pepper, garlic powder or finely chopped garlic]** Prepare spice mix by combining some ratio of cumin, chile powder, salt, pepper, and garlic powder into a small bowl. Not sure how much of each, just kinda splash it in there until there's enough. Or put it directly in the chicken/veggies sautee as needed.

## Cook

 4. **[1 cup black rice, 1 cup wild rice]** Bring 1 cup of black rice and 1 cup of wild rice to a boil in uh...however much water the rice bag calls for, and for however 
long it says. Squeeze juice from 2 limes into rice and stir.
 5. **[3 chicken breasts] [1 can diced tomatoes] [2 cans black beans, only 1 drained]** Prep chicken by cutting off fat and cutting into large chunks (~1.5 inch). Sautee 5-7 minutes or until almost golden brown, and 
add vegetables from step 2. Add half of spice combination and sautee ~5mins, until vegetables are cooked. Add 1 can of diced 
tomatoes, 1 can drained black beans, and 1 can UNdrained black beans; bring to a simmer for 5 mins. and stir ingredients until mixed.
 6. When sweet potatoes are done, remove from oven and add to chicken/beans simmer. And add the rest of the spice mix.
 7. **[Cilantro]** Serve the rice and the chicken mix as a topping. Use cilantro as a garnish.

Goes well with cilantro lime corn (recipe soon to be posted?) and refried plantains (also soon to be posted?)
