title: What's that ":wq" thing at the end of your posts?

Vim is a text editor that many software developers use. ```:wq``` is the vim command
to save and exit the file you're currently editing. Since I pretty much only use vim
to write my blog posts, I adopted it as my signature at the end of blog posts.
